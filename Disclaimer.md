**Disclaimer**

We have years of industry experience in different studios and on different projects. The articles on this site are our opinions and findings that celebrate what we think are the best ways to design games, user interfaces and input based on that experience. This site is an open forum to empower our community to speak freely, and our opinions do not represent the companies whom we work for.

All imagery has been approved by the associated studios/publishers and are intended for education purposes.

We all benefit as a community and are stronger together than a single voice.
We are open to contributions to the discussion.
