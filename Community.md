To help designers build the best UX experiences across the gaming industry, we’ve created this site in partnership between [two industry veterans](https://leesteg.github.io/privatebebo/Authors) from Electronic Arts and Microsoft. 

We do not have all the answers, nor do we have time to cover all areas of Game UX.  

If you are interested in suggesting content to be covered, or would like to contribute to our site, we welcome your comments and content. 

## Ways to contribute 

There are the number of ways for you to provide input to our site.

- **Topic Additions:** We will gather your ideas about a specific feature or a topic and prioritize based on resources.
- **Deep Dives:** If there is a topic already covered but you would like more information, leave a comment on any of our posts.
- **Share Knowledge:** If you have an area you would like to share, let us know and we can help guide you through our submission process.

Although we can’t guarantee any specific ideas will be implemented, we’ll ensure that your ideas and comments are a key influence on future additions.
