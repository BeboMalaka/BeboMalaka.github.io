Set up a workspace conducive to creativity and productivity, a place where you can test your designs properly. Design and build at your desk, but test in an environment that closely simulates that of the player. Use the following equipment to test input and to identify potential issues with legibility, color, and contrast:

#### Recommended desktop workstation:

- Desk
- Ergonomic chair (recommended)
- PC, keyboard, mouse, and controller
- Headphones
- Two monitors (recommended)

#### Recommended review station:

- 42‚Äù television at a minimum, set at least 6 feet from the seating area
- Seating area: couch or chair
- Devkit and controller
- Variable lighting, with the ability to turn the lights on and off
