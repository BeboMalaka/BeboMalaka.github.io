## Theory of Visual Perception
The brain perceives visual information in the following sequence of events:
1.	First, the brain discerns the shape of an object. Silhouettes and large bold shapes make the heaviest imprint on our memory.
2.	Next, the brain interprets color. This is when the brain would perceive an emotion or a brand association. 
3.	Finally, the brain considers the form. Language and content are some example of form, and the brain takes the longest to process these elements.
