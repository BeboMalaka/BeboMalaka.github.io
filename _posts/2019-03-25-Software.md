Use interactive mockups to test out interactions, motion, and usability of your UI. Implement interactive mockups by using the game engine or applications such as Adobe XD, Adobe Flash, and Axure.

If possible, create interactive mockups to use the intended device; using the controller will give you a better feel for the design than using a mouse or keyboard.
