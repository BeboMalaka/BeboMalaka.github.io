### Art Direction: _“Does it feel good?”_  
Art Direction is the use of art and design to create an emotional connection with the player. Art Direction comprises the overall concept and guidelines that the design must follow to ensure the game elicits an emotional response from the player.
Art Direction adds a level of humanity and substance to the design, and it helps tell a story to the targeted market or community.

### Cognitive design: _“Does it look good?”_  
Cognitive Design focuses on the technical execution of topics through the use of color, composition, and legibility. It validates the functionally and implements the visual elements specified by Art Direction.  
 
 Design is the _technical execution_ of the connection between the message and audience. It answers the practical questions about the content, such as:
- Do the colors match? 
- Is copy laid out for a comfortable reading experience? 
- Does the typography use a hierarchy to help categorize information? 
- Are the composition and layout balanced?
