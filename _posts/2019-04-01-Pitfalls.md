Always be on the lookout for anything that can make for an unpleasant user experience. Stick to your guidelines. Donâ€™t copy and paste from other games, because you might lose the opportunity to create the visual identity and feel of your game.

When designing UI for your game, be aware of the following potential problems:

- Poor composition
- Confusing text and graphics
- UI that feels mundane
- Rehashing
- Inconsistencies
- Illegible text
- Information overload
- Chasing fads and short-lived trends when tried and true would serve your needs much better
