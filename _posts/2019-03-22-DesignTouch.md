The best games are most immersive because they make use of the most senses.  
The more senses you want to design for, and the more immersive experience you want to create, the more planning you have to do. Because using the senses of taste and smell in games is not mainstream yet, we’ll focus on the other three senses: touch, sound, and sight.

## Touch
Most console games use a controller that has a set number of buttons and analog joysticks. Because interaction through these elements isn’t as fast or precise as through a mouse or direct touch, you should understand the limitations of your controller device.

The controller’s layout can make or break the players’ experiences with a game. Design your controls to feel as natural as possible. One of the first things to consider is how each button will be used in the gameplay.

| Input Device | Avg Screen Size | Distance/Screen Size | Size/Distance % | Method of Interaction |
| :------ |:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Touch | Small 3.5" | 1' / 12" | 29 | Tap, pinch, swipe
| Mouse & Keyboard | Medium 20" | 3' / 36" | 56 | Mouse & Keyboard, many inputs. Pinpoint accuracy
| Controller | Large 40" | 10' / 120" | 33 | Grid, button navigation. Limited button input.

Console games have been around for decades, so a number of interactions have become standard and are even expected by players today.

Designed primarily to meet the needs of gamers with limited mobility, the Xbox Adaptive Controller is a unified hub for devices and is designed to make gaming more accessible. It works with a range of external devices (such as switches, buttons, mounts, and joysticks) to create a customizable controller experience unique to a player.
